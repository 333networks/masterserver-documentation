The masterserver is a software server that receives data from online multiplayer game servers and presents a list of all online multiplayer game servers to the users/gamers. This is often a commercial service provided by various game developers and/or software enterprises. When the largest master server provider permanently went offline in 2014, support for a number of online multiplayer games was dropped.

Various implementations of the masterserver concept were written by corporate parties and have been kept closed-source. To fully support all online games that were affected by the GameSpy shutdown, an alternate masterserver should become available, controlled by the community, for the community. Eventually, the thought of an all-powerful community masterserver starts with the writing and availability of the software as described in this document.\\
